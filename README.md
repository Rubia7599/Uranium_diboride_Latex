# Uranium_diboride_Latex
The potential candidates of ATF, Uranium Diboride in GitHub.
This common template enables future reports to have a example template to use.

1. In Windows, you need TeX distribution to comtrol your Tex package, install one like Miktek, TinyTeX etc.

2. Create a folder in anywhere you want, then right click to open Powershell in the folder, then enter the command in the follow <br>
```git clone https://github.com/Rubia7599/Uranium_diboride_Latex.git```

3. Using the text editor like TeXworks, VScode...... then start your report time!

It is universally acknowledged that power generation is most fundamental facility required
by every industry, as almost all things require electricity to work. Among all the methods
of electricity generation, nuclear power always faces considerable scrutiny. Undoubtedly,
nuclear power brings about feelings of fear and unknown horror, especially after the accidents
at Fukushima and Chernobyl. Such concerns are not unreasonable, as peopleâ€™s fear of nuclear
power is a good measure to prevent accidents from happening. However, Taiwan people are
too afraid of using this technology, turns out the result is miss out the opportunity to improve
our ecosystem and make it more environmentally friendly. In this research, I would put the
focus on the potentially fuel, Uranium diboride (UB2), an interesting fuel that nowadays are
research to be an ATF candidate fuel. Its physical properties also make it suitable for use in
GEN-IV reactors, which require high standards to reaction. All of these factors make UB2
show on my eyes, and this research aims to explore its potential
