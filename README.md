The potential candidates of ATF, Uranium Diboride

It is universally acknowledged that power generation is most fundamental facility required by every
industry, as almost all things require electricity to work. Among all the methods of electricity generation, nuclear power always faces considerable scrutiny. Undoubtedly, nuclear power brings about
feelings of fear and unknown horror, especially after the accidents at Fukushima and Chernobyl. Such
concerns are not unreasonable, as peopleâ€™s fear of nuclear power is a good measure to prevent accidents
from happening. However, Taiwan people are too afraid of using this technology, turns out the result
is miss out the opportunity to improve our ecosystem and make it more environmentally friendly. In
this research, I would put the focus on the potentially fuel, Uranium diboride (UB2), an interesting fuel
that nowadays are research to be an ATF candidate fuel. Its physical properties also make it suitable
for use in GEN-IV reactors, which require high standards to reaction. All of these factors make UB2
show on my eyes, and this research aims to explore its potential
